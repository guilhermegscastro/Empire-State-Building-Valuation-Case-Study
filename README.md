# ESB Case Study — ARGUS Enterprise & Excel Valuation

## Overview

This case study analyzes a commercial real estate asset using two industry-standard approaches:

* **ARGUS Enterprise model (.ae file)** for institutional-grade cash flow modeling
* **Excel financial model (.xlsx)** for transparent, manual underwriting and validation

The objective is to demonstrate proficiency in:

* Real estate financial modeling
* Lease abstraction and cash flow projection
* Valuation methodology (NOI, cap rate, IRR, NPV)
* Cross-validation between ARGUS and Excel

---

## Files Included

### ARGUS Enterprise Model

* Complete property cash flow model
* Lease structure and rollover assumptions
* Market leasing profile
* Valuation outputs

### Excel Valuation Model

* Step-by-step underwriting
* NOI build-up
* Discounted cash flow (DCF)
* Sensitivity analysis
* Final valuation outputs

---

## Methodology

### 1. Lease Abstraction

Tenant information, rent structure, and rollover assumptions were incorporated into both ARGUS and Excel.

### 2. Cash Flow Modeling

Future income, reimbursements, expenses, and leasing assumptions were modeled.

### 3. NOI Construction

NOI calculated through revenue less operating expenses and recoveries.

### 4. Valuation Approach

Both models apply:

* Cap rate valuation
* Discounted cash flow analysis
* Terminal value assumptions

## Key Outputs

* Stabilized NOI
* Levered & unlevered IRR
* Net Present Value (NPV)
* Exit valuation
* Cash flow comparison: ARGUS vs Excel

## How to Use This Case Study

1. Open the ARGUS file to review lease structures and institutional modeling workflow.
2. Use the Excel file to understand assumptions and manual valuation logic.
3. Compare outputs between both tools to validate results.
