# ESB Case Study — ARGUS Valuation & Excel Investment Consolidation

## 📌 Overview

This case study models the valuation of the Empire State Building investment using a two-stage workflow:

1. **ARGUS Enterprise** used to determine the **purchase price (present value) of the building mixed-use retail/office leasing operations**
2. **Excel financial model** used to **consolidate the full investment**, combining:

   * Building valuation (from ARGUS)
   * Observatory business component
   * Final investment return metrics

---

## 🏢 Project Structure

### 📊 Stage 1 — Building Valuation (ARGUS Enterprise)

ARGUS is used to:

* Model leases and rent roll
* Project operating cash flows
* Apply market leasing assumptions
* Apply financial market assumptions
* Generate stabilized NOI
* Determine **present value / acquisition price of the building**

**ARGUS - Tenant Summary**

### 📊 Stage 2 — Investment Consolidation (Excel)

The Excel model integrates:

* ARGUS-derived building purchase price, rent roll and cash flow
* Observatory operating income
* Capital structure assumptions
* Return metrics

**Excel — Observatory Financials**

---

### 2. Valuation & Returns

Excel calculates:

* Cap rate
* IRR
* Hold Period Avg. Cash on Cash
* Equity multiple
* LTV
* DSCR
* Debt Yield

---

### 3. Sensitivity Analysis

Stress tests performed on:

* Cap rate
* Purchase price
* Equity multiple
* IRR
