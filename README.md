# ESB Case Study — ARGUS Valuation & Excel Investment Consolidation

## 📌 Overview

This case study models the valuation of the Empire State Building investment using a two-stage workflow:

1. **ARGUS Enterprise** used to determine the **purchase price (present value) of the building mixed-use retail/office leasing operations**
2. **Excel financial model** used to **consolidate the full investment**, combining:

   * Building valuation (from ARGUS)
   * Observatory business component
   * Final investment return metrics
