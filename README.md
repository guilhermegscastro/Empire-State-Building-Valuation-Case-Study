# ESB Case Study — ARGUS Valuation & Excel Investment Consolidation

## 📌 Overview

This case study models the valuation of the Empire State Building investment using a two-stage institutional workflow:

1. **ARGUS Enterprise** used to determine the **purchase price (present value) of the building operations**
2. **Excel financial model** used to **consolidate the full investment**, combining:

   * Building valuation (from ARGUS)
   * Observatory business component
   * Final investment return metrics

This reflects how real-world CRE underwriting separates **asset valuation** from **investment structuring**.

## 🏢 Project Structure

### 📊 Stage 1 — Building Valuation (ARGUS Enterprise)

ARGUS is used to:

* Model leases and rent roll
* Project operating cash flows
* Apply market leasing assumptions
* Generate stabilized NOI
* Determine **present value / acquisition price of the building**

This represents the institutional CRE valuation step.

### 📊 Stage 2 — Investment Consolidation (Excel)

The Excel model integrates:

* ARGUS-derived building purchase price
* Observatory operating income
* Capital structure assumptions
* Investment cash flows
* Return metrics

This reflects the **actual deal-level underwriting**.

**Excel — Observatory Financials**
