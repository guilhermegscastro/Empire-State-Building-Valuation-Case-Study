🏙️ Empire State Building Valuation Case Study

ARGUS Enterprise + Excel Investment Model

📌 Overview

This project presents a full institutional-grade CRE valuation of the Empire State Building using:

ARGUS Enterprise for lease-level cash flow modeling

Excel for valuation, observatory underwriting, financing, and equity waterfall

The objective was to simulate how investment and brokerage teams underwrite complex mixed-use assets where traditional lease income and operating-business income must be modeled separately.

🧠 Modeling Approach
Step 1 — Lease Modeling (ARGUS)

Modeled office, retail, and antenna leases

Applied market leasing profiles

Modeled rollover risk, TI/LC, downtime

Generated stabilized property cash flows

Step 2 — Observatory Valuation (Excel)

Revenue projections

Expense and margin assumptions

NOI stabilization

Separate cap-rate valuation

Step 3 — Integration

Imported ARGUS outputs

Combined lease NOI + observatory NOI

Built consolidated proforma

Step 4 — Investment Returns

Debt modeling

Levered cash flows

Equity waterfall

IRR & equity multiple

📊 Investment Insights

Key value drivers identified in the model:

Observatory income contributes materially to total asset value

Lease rollover concentration impacts early hold-period risk

Exit cap sensitivity significantly affects valuation

Debt structure meaningfully changes investor IRR

(Optional: later you can replace with quantified insights)
